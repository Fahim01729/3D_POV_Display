This is my Final Year Project cosisting of a spinning helix of LED strips. There are a total of 56 leds that can display 1400 Voxels with 8 colours. The voxels are arranged circularly in 7 levels. 

The Leds are controllerd by only one microcontroller and as I've used SK9822 LED strips, I no longer required additional transistors or drivers.
